- Persistent Navigation: Sticky Navbar: Implements a navigation bar with links to different sections (Home, About, Skills, Projects, Resume, Contact) that remains fixed at the top of the page as the user scrolls.
- Dynamic Landing: Hero Section with Typing Animation: A landing section with a catchy tagline and a subline, featuring a typing animation that rotates between different titles (e.g., 'Curious Coder,' 'Problem Solver').
- Skills Showcase: Interactive Skills Display: Skills are presented in a grid or tag style, categorized by Languages, Frontend, Backend, Database, Tools & Deployment, and Design Tools. Tags should glow on hover with smooth animations.
